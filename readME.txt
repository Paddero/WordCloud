Wordcloud program will create a PNG image from a file. Limited to 200 words to make sure it fits the image space.

To run the program you must run it by entering the file you want to parse as well as the stopwords text file you provided us with.

E.G. of running the program from the src folder.
java –cp ./wordcloud.jar ie.gmit.sw.Runner "../warandpeace.txt" "../stopwords.txt"

The image should be generated in the SRC folder.
